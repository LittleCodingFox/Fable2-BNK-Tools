# What is this project?

This is an ancient piece of tech I made during my days when Fable 2 was launched and people wanted to make mods.

I never managed to do any mods myself but I wanted to learn how people decoded and changed data for games like Fable 2.

This is a repo with that code, and doesn't reflect my current ability to code. This is from way back in 2008 or so.

The programs are located at `Fable2Mod/Tests`, and there's a solution file for modern visual studio in the root directory.
